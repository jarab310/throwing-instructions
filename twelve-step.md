1. Gather your materials:

  At minimum have your wheel, water, wire tool, scale, a slab of wood, a plastic bag, and hand towel.

2. Set up your wheel:

  Plug it in, put your foot pedal where you want and if you have two spin directions make sure it is set to your hand dominance's prefferred direction. For right handed people this is a clockwise spin, for left a counter-clockwise spin. Finally, put your water on your wheel's extra space.

3. Getting your clay:

  Grab some clay and measure it out. If you are just beginning don't take more than 2 pounds.

4. Wedge your clay:

   This is done by repeatedly smushing, rolling up and smashing your clay into a table or your wheel. This is done to get any air out of your clay. After you have finished shape your clay into a small cone shape.

5. Centering your clay part 1:

  Slam the flat bottom of your small clay cone onto the middle of your wheel. Now start spinning your wheel and put your dominant hand on the side of your cone and other hand into a fist on top, and push down with your fist while keeping your other hand steady. When your clay gets hot or hard take some water and splash on your clay.

6. Centering your clay part 2:

  Once you have pressed down put both hands on the sides and squeeze your clay into a cone shape again. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until your clay is cylindrical shape in the center of your wheel. Don't forget water if you need.

7. Opening:

  Take your thumbs and pull out from the center of your piece and pull up and out. If you want to pull more, take your non-dominant hand and pull while keeping your dominant outside your non-domninant.As always add water when needed. Stop once you have pulled as much as you want.

8. Finishing up:

  Stop spinning and grab your wire tool. Put some water around the bottom of your piece and pull your wire tool through the base of your bowl. Now lift up your bowl off of the wheel and put it on your wood. Now to keep your bowl moist and until you are ready to trim, pull your plastic bag over your bowl leaving no opening to prevent dryings.
